        <h2>schooling</h2>

    <div class="action" id="action1" href="#"><h5>pacific design academy, victoria</h5></div>
        <div id="showOrHideDiv1" style="display: none;">
            <p>Currently, I am a student at Pacific Design Academy taking my second year of website and application development. <br>
                This two-year program focuses on developing skills that will equip me for a career as a developer across a broad range of fields.
                Skills gained from this program include practice in various languages & libraries such as CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JQuery, Java in Android Studio,
                C#, MySQL, node.js, Express, angular and some Php. In addition we have had classes in Project Management/Business Analyst, web/app design, UI, and UX.
                <br>When this program is complete in June of 2019, I wish to focus my skills towards becoming a front-end web app developer with strong UX/UI
                capabilities, but never ceasing to learn new skills. Until then, I hope to improve and grow on my current skills, work on building a strong portfolio, and gain additional language skills
                during my final 2 semesters of class.

        <div class="action" id="action2" href="#"><h5>millennium specialty alloys ltd, kelowna</h5></div>
        <div id="showOrHideDiv2" style="display: none;">
        <p>For three and a half years I was employed at Millennium Specialty Alloys, a metal wholesaler for interior BC located in Kelowna.<br>
            This was a very fast paced, busy environment where multiple shipments came in and out daily. My basic duties included reception & the processing
            of payments, customer service and writing up sales orders, directing foot traffic and phone lines, accounts payable, bi monthly cheque runs,
            organizing customer’s orders, double & triple checking incoming & received shipments. I became skillful at prioritizing & time management
            since often my duties were postponed by the needs of our customers and the overflow workload of my coworkers.<br> By my second year of employment
            I was promoted to fill my co-worker’s maternity leave. On top of my original duties, I was now in charge of managing orders through the warehouse,
            invoicing and billing customers, accounts receivable & collections, filling out vendor purchase orders, and taking on overflow sales and pricing
            during busy hours. I am now quite comfortable with multitasking, and I thoroughly enjoy staying busy – Which means that any time I could catch a
            break, I would clean the office!

        <div id="showOrHideDiv3" style="display: none;">
        <p>For the last year while I have been a student, I have been employed as landscaper for Fallingwater Property Services in the greater Victoria area.<br>
            Gardeners are expected to work as quickly and efficiently as possible, where we were trained to anticipate tasks and prepare our tools to
            eliminate unnecessary trips to and from the trailer. I received thorough training in all areas of landscaping and safety such as weed-eating,
            mowing, leaf blowing, hedge trimming, weeding/cultivating/raking of beds, mulching, operating on ladders, and any additional jobs that were
            asked of me. <br>
            Secondary skills included plant identification and care, task time management and estimation, and as a bonus: strength and endurance.

        <div class="action" id="action4" href="#"><h5>gadgets computers, olds & sundre ab</h5></div>
        <div id="showOrHideDiv4" style="display: none;">
        <p>At Gadgets Computers and Electronics, I expanded my understanding of electronics. Through SAGE simply accounting I kept track of receipts,
            accounts receivable, accounts payable, transferring money between accounts and keeping inventory up to date in the system. I helped people find
            exactly what they needed, and if the store didn’t carry it, I would find a way to get that product, whether it was transferring inventory between
            locations, or ordering it through our vendors.<br>
            I answered most every call, and developed strong communication skills, both written (e-mailing through Outlook) and oral.  I entered all invoices
            that would come with the daily orders and I also worked the cash register, including daily cash out. When things got slow I would sometimes
            deliver orders to customers, or more often, I would clean the store just to keep on my feet.

    <h1>about me</h1>
    <br>
    <div class="action" id="action5" href="#"><h5>my story</h5></div>
    <div id="showOrHideDiv5" style="display: none;">
    <p>I was raised just outside the small town of Sundre, Alberta (pop. 2500) until the age of 19 when I packed my bags and flew to New Zealand where myself
        and two other girls lived and travelled in a van for 3 unreal months. Soon after I flew home, I packed my bags yet again and moved West to Kelowna.<br>
        I really loved the 3+ years I spent there, but couldn't help but feel like I needed to see more of the world. In 2015 I spent 3 months solo backpacking
        across South East Asia where I travelled by bus, train, plane, and boat through Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Indonesia.<br>
        When I flew home, I set my sights on where my next steps would be. I always wanted to live in Victoria, and I always knew I would.
        I also always knew I would find myself perusing a career somewhere in the world of technology. Within half a year I found myself moving West again,
        where my story continues to build and I continue to work towards my career goals.
